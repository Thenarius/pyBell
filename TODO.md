Core program:
* Ensure that the new method of checking the time every second does, indeed, function without bugs. 
* Ensure that all the right sounds are chiming at all the right times.


Planned features:
- More Chimes
	* Plans: Angelus bells (6am, noon, and 6pm), Ave Maria (alternative to the Westminster chimes)...
- Custom Schedule
- Volume Control
- An interface, for all of this (probably text).
	* Investigate command-line options.
	* How will the interface coexist with the main program loop, without interruption thereof?
