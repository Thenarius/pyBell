A basic program to sound chimes at every quarter-hour -- useful as a gentle, but constant reminder to change focus.

The program currently sounds the [Westminster chimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Quarters) on every quarter-hour. However, the abilities to add custom sounds (or at least more variety) and create a custom chime schedule are in the works.
